#From Virality to Visibility

@Quantifying the Impact of TikTok Virality on Spotify Streaming Success

This project explores the intersection of social media virality and music data analytics. Using weekly chart data from TikTok and Spotify (sourced via Chartmetric) and acoustic features from the Spotify Web API, the study investigates how short-form video virality translates into streaming performance.

At its core, the project applies multilevel regression modeling and machine learning techniques to quantify the spillover effect between the two platforms. It examines whether songs that go viral on TikTok subsequently rise in Spotify charts, and how this relationship is influenced by intrinsic audio characteristics such as danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, and acousticness.

By combining principles from Hit Song Science (HSS) and social media analytics, the project provides a data-driven framework for understanding what drives modern music visibility across platforms.

Key components:
	•	Data collected from Chartmetric (TikTok & Spotify charts, 2021–2025)
	•	Spotify API integration for song-level audio features
	•	Extensive data cleaning, merging, and feature engineering in R and Python
	•	Logistic, ordinal, and continuous multilevel regression modeling
	•	Analysis of moderating effects of song characteristics on cross-platform success

Goal:
To uncover how algorithmic virality and musical composition interact in shaping hit dynamics — bridging marketing analytics, data science, and music industry insights.
